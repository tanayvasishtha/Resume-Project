        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>As a B-Tech student, I am driven by passion for exploring the intersection of technology and society. With a
            strong foundation in mathematics and science, I am constantly seeking new challenges to enhance my skills
            and knowledge.</p>

        <p>During my leisure time at college, I have been actively involved in various extracurricular activities,
            including graphic designing, video editing and photography, which have helped me develop a creative approach
            to problem-solving. I have also taken on creative roles in student organizations, which have taught me
            valuable skills in communication and teamwork.</p>
        <p>With a keen interest in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, I am eager to
            contribute my knowledge and skills to the tech industry. I am seeking opportunities to gain hands-on
            experience through internships or projects, and I am excited to connect with professionals in the field.</p>

        <p>My ultimate goal is to use my technical expertise to create innovative solutions that positively impact
            society. I am committed to lifelong learning and constantly pushing myself to grow both personally and
            professionally. </p>
        <p>Let's connect and explore the possibilities together.</p>
